TODO V2
----------------------------
1. Expand regular (email login), add few more values during regular login (like first name and last name).
   Add possibility in the backend for them to define custom options they want to collect during sign up.
   Custom ones are going to be saved as user meta data
2. Add posibility (options within backend) to be able to remove regular (email login) and not to use it at all
   - this can be handy if user wants to use only social logins
3. Add twitter login/signup as well
4. Use pure js -> server switch for google login (similar technique we are using with facebook login).
5. Send email upon login. Add posibility in backend for user to be able to style/write custom welcome email
   on sign up.
6. Add forgot password form on login page shortcode (add posibility in option to show/hide it)
   - Password change should follow secure logic, by sending password change link with generated md5 string
     which is going to expire within 1 hr. In order for this to work, we need to use either custom xmlrpc function or
     either additional shortcode (more complicated and not recommended)
7. Facebook, twitter and google login, they needs to be implemented as separated reusable modules
8. Implement possibility to manage posts you published
9. Add statistics per post
