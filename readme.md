# Contributer - Guest Posting
Contributer enables your guests to easily create front-end post with videos, images or galleries. Transform your blog into a place of sharing and collaboration. 

## Description

Transform your blog into a place of collaboration. Adds a basic front-end post creator form via shortcode to your blog and enable your visitors to submit posts and upload images or videos. Our user-submitted posts plugin taps into the standard post-type function of WordPress and includes featured-image, video, image and gallery posts. It integrates tags, categories, post titles, and more. Published posts are set to “pending for review”. The plugin enables you to define if, your users need to be logged-in (Facebook, Google+, Email) or can post freely without login. Our Google Captcha integration filters unwanted spam. Logged-in users have the possibility to edit their profile settings in the front-end profile editor and change their profile picture without the need of a Gravatar account. The can edit their bio, website and social links in the profile front-end editor as well. Happy blogging!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does the plugin work with my theme

Contributor is designed to work with any compatible theme running and it uses the WordPress custom post types function. Some themes don’t use custom post types, so check if these are enabled. 

### What about security and spam?

Contributor uses the WordPress API to keep everything secure, and includes Google captcha and hidden fields to stop spam and bots. It’s strongly recommend to use Google captcha even though the plugin will work without it.
